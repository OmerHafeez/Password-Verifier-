# Password-Verifier-
Password Verifier: Imagine you are developing a software package that requires users to enter
their own passwords. Your software requires that users’ passwords meet the following criteria:
The password should be at least six characters long.
The password should contain at least one uppercase and at least one lowercase letter.
The password should have at least one digit.
Write a function that accepts a pointer to a C-string as its argument for a password and then verifies that it
meets the stated criteria.
If it doesn’t, the program should display a message telling the user why.
